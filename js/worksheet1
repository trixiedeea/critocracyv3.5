State Management Issues:
_state.player (template object) is being confused with _state.game.players (actual player data)
Resources are stored in both player.resources and _state.playerResources
Resource Display Issues:
The display code in 
updateResourceDisplays
 assumes resources are in player.resources
Some code might still be updating _state.playerResources instead
End Game Issues:
Final scores aren't being calculated correctly because resources aren't being tracked consistently
Proposed Fixes:
Unify Resource Storage:
Choose one location to store resources (preferably directly in player objects)
Update all resource-related functions to use this single source
Update Resource Display:
Modify 
updateResourceDisplays
 to use the correct resource location
Ensure all resource updates trigger a display update
Fix End Game Calculation:
Make sure final resource totals are calculated from the correct source
Update the end game screen to display the correct values
Would you like me to start implementing these fixes? I can begin with the most critical issue first.

Here's a summary of where player resources are being used:

player.resources is used in:
ui.js:
Updates UI display of resources
Shows knowledge, money, and influence counts
resourceManagement.js:
Main resource handling logic
Updates and tracks resource values
Handles resource changes and calculations
players.js:
Player creation and management
Debug logging of resources
Resource initialization and updates
state.playerResources is used in:
state.js:
Storage of player resources by ID
Part of the main state management
resourceManagement.js:
getPlayerResources()
 function
Fallback for resource lookups
players.js:
getPlayerResources()
 function
Resource initialization
Key Issues:
Dual Storage:
Resources are stored in both player.resources and state.playerResources
This can lead to synchronization issues
Inconsistent Access:
Some code uses player.resources directly
Other code uses 
getPlayerResources()
State Management:
_state.player was removed, but some code might still reference it
Need to ensure all code uses _state.game.players
Recommendation:
Choose One Storage Method:
Prefer player.resources for direct access
Remove state.playerResources entirely
Update All References:
Replace 
getPlayerResources()
 with direct player.resources access
Ensure all resource updates go through a single function
Test Thoroughly:
Resource updates
UI display
End game calculations

In state.js:
Update the 
updatePlayerResources
 function to use the new structure:
javascript
export function updatePlayerResources(playerId, resources) {
    _state.player.resources[playerId] = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(resources));
    notifySubscribers();
}
In ui.js:
updateResourceDisplayContainer
 function needs to use the new path:
javascript
panelUpdated.querySelector('.KNOWLEDGE_COUNT').textContent = `Knowledge ${player.resources.money}`;
panelUpdated.querySelector('.MONEY_COUNT').textContent = `Money ${player.resources.knowledge}`;
panelUpdated.querySelector('.INFLUENCE_COUNT').textContent = `Influence ${player.resources.influence}`;
In resourceManagement.js:
handleStealEffect
 needs to be updated to use the new path:
javascript
const targetResources = state.player.resources[targetPlayer.id] || {};
In players.js:
getPlayerScore
 function (commented out but should be updated if used):
javascript
// score += Object.values(state.player.resources[player.id] || {}).reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
In cards.js:
Any direct resource access should be updated to use the new path through state.player.resources[playerId]
The main changes involve:

Replacing direct player.resources access with state.player.resources[playerId]
Updating any functions that modify resources to use the new centralized state
Ensuring all resource reads go through the state object
Would you like me to help implement any of these changes? I can make the updates systematically to ensure everything works correctly with the new state structure.



    // Clear the current content of the displays before updating
    resourceDisplayContainer.innerHTML = '';
    playerScoreDisplay.innerHTML = '';
