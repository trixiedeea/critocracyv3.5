# CritocracyV3.4
Game Overview
Players take on the roles of historical and ideological figures—Revolutionary, Historian, Colonialist, Entrepreneur, Politician, or Artist—navigating through four thematic Ages inspired by critical and postcolonial theory. The objective is to accumulate Money, Knowledge, and Influence while facing historical dilemmas, alliances, and sabotage. The player with the highest combined total of resources at the end wins. However, if a player reaches zero in any category, they are eliminated.
Game Board Design
The board is made up of 4 linear pathways, each one an Age, each inspired by historical themes and key texts:
The Age of Expansion (Colonization & Exploitation) Pink
Inspired by Aimé Césaire’s Discourse on Colonialism.
Events: The Scramble for Africa, The Atlantic Slave Trade, Indigenous Displacement.
Pros/Cons: Accumulate wealth and power while navigating resistance.
The Age of Resistance (Revolts & Intellectual Awakening) Blue
Inspired by Walter Benjamin’s Angel of History and anti-colonial movements.
Events: Haitian Revolution, Gandhi’s Salt March, The Printing Press Revolution.
Pros/Cons: Risk political resistance, rewrite history, or maintain control.
The Age of Reckoning (Decolonization & Narrative Battles) Purple
Inspired by The Death of the Author (Roland Barthes) and postcolonial struggles.
Events: End of Apartheid, Museum Artifact Repatriation, Rise of Postcolonial Literature.
Pros/Cons: Risk reputations, lose or solidify power, influence historical narratives.
The Age of Legacy (Who Controls History?) Cyan
Inspired by Benjamin’s Concept of History and modern historiography.
Events: Social Media Debates on History, AI & Digital Archives, Monument Controversies.
Pros/Cons: Risk knowledge and influence, historical revisionism, gain money            through new technologies and opportunities
Game Components
Game Board: A linear map with 4 interconnected pathways and special event spaces. The elements on the game board will all be transparent. The board itself will be the .png image used as the background image with ALL the objects transparently overlayed on top it. The objects are as follows:
Regular Spaces:
Purple Path Player spaces: players must follow the progression of the sequential coordinates of each of the four paths when moving unless they are able to switch to another path in which case they follow that sequence thereafer

There are also special event spaces. If a player land on a special event space they must draw a card from the correspondingly colored card deck, the four ages mentioned at the beginning. This is why the paths must be color tagged even though they are transparent, a player can only be allowed to pick a card from the deck matching the color of the age they are in/path they are on. All these points are transparent. The special event spaces are as follows:

Role Cards: Players select a role, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.
Resource Tokens: Three resources—Money, Knowledge, and Influence. Players resources will be tallied as they go along and stored in their resource bag.
Event Cards: Two types—
End of Turn Cards, each having a specific consequence for each possible player role 
Age Of * Cards which allow for player rewards or movements
 1 Dice: Determines movement. Standard six sided dice. There will need to be a button added allowing players to roll the dice and allowing them to move. Players will also determine order by a roll of the dice before the game starts highest goes first then down the list alphabetically by role (Historian, Entrepreneur, Artist, Colonialist, Politician and Revolutionary)
Player tokens. PNG files located at \board game\assets\tokens\ one png file for each player
H.png for Historian
A.png for Artist
R.png for Revolutionary
E.png for Entrepreneur
C.png for Colonialist
P.png for Politician 
Setup
Choose a Role:
Revolutionary: 14 Knowledge, 8 Influence (Opposes Colonialist)
Historian: 14 Knowledge, 8 Money (Opposes Politician)
Colonialist: 14 Money, 8 Influence (Opposes Revolutionary)
Entrepreneur: 14 Money, 8 Knowledge (Opposes Artist)
Politician: 14 Influence, 8 Money (Opposes Historian)
Artist: 14 Influence, 8 Knowledge (Opposes Entrepreneur)
Distribute Starting Resources.
Shuffle Cards. There are 4 different event cards matching the colors of the paths on the board. Place the cards in the color coded boxes that match the colors of the cards. Place the End Of Turn cards in either or both of the end of turn boxes.
Decide First Player: Roll a die.

Gameplay
Each turn, a player:
Rolls a standard 6 sided dice and moves
Lands on a game space:
Regular Spaces: No effect.  
Event Spaces: Draws a Special Event Space Card.
Draws an End of Turn Card (mandatory).
Resolves effects based on their role.
Ends turn.
Strategic Mechanics
These are all entirely dictated by the Age of * cards. Some of the cards may allow players to steal resources, etc. 
Players may switch paths whenever they pass a multi-directional space, the coordinates of which were already noted above. 
Cards must always be returned to the bottom of the respective deck before the next player's turn starts 
Victory Conditions
The game ends when after all players reach the finish square. Some players may take more turns than others to finish depending on their paths and cards so the game may go one even after another player or all other players have crossed the finish line.
The player with the highest combined total of Money, Knowledge, and Influence and position wins. Position is determined after the game has finished based on the players finish position.
All End of turn cards can be found at ../assets/cards/endofturncards.js
All path cards can be found in ../assets/cards/AgeOf*Cards.js
Listeners will have to be set up  for dice rolls, space clicks, direction change clicks, resource management, other.  The board image in located at \board game\board.png
